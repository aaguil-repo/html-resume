    <h2>A Little About Myself:</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Andy! I want to thank you for taking the time to see my first capstone project for this course. The following is a little about me and the things I like to do.</p>
    <h2>What I Like To Do:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Being creative with some very bad sketches</li>
        <br>
        <li>Playing videogames, here are some of my favorites:
            <ul>
                <li>Prey (2017) - One of the best immersive sims out there!</li>
                <li>Battlefield Series - I love the dynamicism and sandbox, although the series has kinda struggled unfortunately. </li>
                <li>Deep Rock Galactic - You get to play as dwarves in space, mining and surviving a bug horde. For rock and stone!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Tinkering

                <li>Modding my Steam Deck.</li>
                <li>Not a car guy, but I do not mind doing some easy maintenance.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
